# milk_quality_prediction
Quality of a milk decides whether a milk good to take or not. In India, infants are mostly depend on vitamins from milk. So a good quality milk plays a vital role in this society. To ensure that a good milk reaches the hands of future generation, I designed this milk quality prediction program to predict the quality of milk. 
To predict the quality of milk I have used a dataset containing 100 brand samples and for further clarity I have referred certain parameters.

Parameters:
1. pH
2. Temperature
3. Taste
4. Odour
5. Fat
6. Turbidity
7. Colour
8. Vitamins Ratio

With this I have categorized the grades of the samples in high, medium, low.

Using these datas my program will predict the quality of the milk with clear pictorical representation.
