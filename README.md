Quality of a milk decides whether a milk is good to take or not. In India, infants are mostly depend on vitamins from milk. So a good quality milk plays a vital role in this society. To ensure that a good milk reaches the hands of future generation, I designed a milk quality prediction.

# INTRODUCTION

Milk quality prediction is a critical task in the dairy industry, as it directly impacts the safety and consistency of dairy products. To address this challenge, I have developed a Milk Quality Prediction System using the Intel OneAPI Toolkit, a powerful and versatile set of tools for high-performance computing across a variety of Intel architectures. This system leverages the computational capabilities of Intel's hardware to predict milk quality based on various factors and historical data.

The IntelÂ® OneAPI toolkit enables models to be trained in a more efficient way and results in faster training times.
Intel OneAPI Toolkit is a comprehensive suite of tools and libraries for high-performance computing that provides support for various tasks, including machine learning. While Intel OneAPI doesn't have a specific function for train-test split like some machine learning libraries do (e.g., scikit-learn in Python), you can perform train-test splitting using the standard techniques in your chosen programming language (e.g., C++, Fortran) and then utilize Intel OneAPI tools for the actual model training and inference.

**Train-Test Split:**

Using standard techniques from my programming language to split my dataset into training and testing subsets.
Typically, the dataset is divided into two parts: a training set used for model training and a test set used for model evaluation.

**Data Processing:**

I preprocessed my data, including tasks like feature scaling, normalization, and handling missing values. 

**Model Training and Inference:**

I utilized Intel OneAPI libraries and tools to develop and train your machine learning models.
I trained my model using the training dataset.

**Model Evaluation:**

After training, I evaluated the model's performance using the test dataset. Computed metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error, depending on my specific problem (classification or regression).

**Iterate and Optimize:**

Based on the evaluation results, I iterated my model, fine-tune hyperparameters, and optimized its performance as needed.

# METHODOLOGY
The model was trained using milknew data(brand,pH,temperature,taste,odour,fat,turbidity,colour,vitamins,grade) to enhance its technical proficiency.

# Benefits

**Improved Milk Quality:** By predicting milk quality, dairy farmers can take proactive measures to maintain and enhance the quality of their dairy products.

**Increased Efficiency:** Parallel processing and optimization for Intel hardware ensure that the system operates efficiently, delivering faster results**.

**Scalability:** The system can be scaled to handle large volumes of data, making it suitable for both small and large dairy farms.

**Real-time Monitoring:** Integration with real-time data streams allows for immediate action when anomalies are detected.
